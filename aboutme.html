        <h3 id="description">Hello! <br>
            I’ve lived in over 30 different cities across the U.S., so moving around is basically second nature to me at this point. Every place has had something special about it, but the Seattle area has definitely been my favorite. I love the mix of mountains, cool weather, and that cozy Pacific Northwest vibe. <br>

I married my husband, Jeffrey in August 2025, and he’s truly my best friend. He was born in Honduras and moved to Florida when he was 12. 

We’re expecting our first baby in early July, which still feels surreal to say! We’re so excited to step into this new chapter as parents. <br>

I’ve always loved reading, running, video games, and learning new things. 

Thank you for visiting my webpage!</h3>
